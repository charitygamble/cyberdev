The amy kaybach website is a combination of a website and blog for an indie romance author, Amy Kaybach. 

### Technologies Used
This project uses WordPress as its backbone, along with a customized version of the Kadence theme.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
One of the biggest challenges faced when creating this iteration of Amy's website was the use of Kadence and getting everything to sit where we wanted it. However, with perserverance and a few YouTube tutorials when I got completely stuck, I was able to come up with a website that Amy loved and that suited her purposes perfectly.
