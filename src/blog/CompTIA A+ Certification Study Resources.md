As a cybersecurity student, I have a lot of certification exams to take. I've taken the CCST (Cisco Certified Support Technician) Cybersecurity exam, the CompTIA Network+ exam, and the CompTIA Security+ exam - and I've passed all of them. But those certifications were taken with the help of a class. That isn't the case for my A+ certification.

To be fair, I did take a class on A+ certification preparation in Spring 2025, but between my taking the class and my beginning to actually prepare for the exams, a new version of the A+ exams was released. So I had to change up my study resources a bit.

Here are the resources I've been using:
- Sybex A+ Study Guides for 220-1201 and 220-1202. I bought these on Amazon for $39 for the set, but prices may have changed since.
- Professor Messer's video series for A+ 220-1201 and 220-1202 on YouTube. You can either search for Professor Messer on YouTube or go to ProfessorMesser.com to find links to his videos.
