This web-only code editor was created from a tutorial on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. 

### Technologies Used
This web-only code editor uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I tweaked the original tutorial to allow it to be built using Eleventy, while still retaining its function. I used Netlify to host the code editor, using a Github repo as the method of importing it to Netlify.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
For this particular project, my biggest challenge was getting the JavaScript to work the way it was supposed to. However, once I managed to get the JavaScript working, I was able to have some fun with this and convert the original tutorial project into an Eleventy project.
